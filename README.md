This repo is packaged as an Arduino library in order to access the EducationalBP_MKII examples that are included as part of the [Energia application][1]. It is not actually a library, but includes an `examples` folder so that Arduino will load the files and display the examples.

Because these examples are included in the Energia application itself, they are not available when loading [Texas Instruments platform cores][5] into Arduino using the Boards Manager. I have therefore packaged them as a library so that they can be loaded into Arduino and be accessible through the `File->Examples->Energia-EducationalBP_MKII` menu.

## Installation

Use the `Code -> Download ZIP` button in GitHub to download the library as a ZIP file. Then, from the Arduino GUI, select the `Sketch->Include Library->Add ZIP Library` to install the library.

## Usage

The example sketches are available from the `File->Examples->Energia-EducationalBP_MKII` menu.

## Documentation

The Energia website has an [overview][6] of the Educational BoosterPack, and tutorials for several of the example sketches.

In case the Energia website goes offline, the overview and tutorial files are also available in the [`extras/docs`][8] directory in this repository. These files are also available in the [energia.nu][9] GitHub repo which contains the source files for the energia.nu website.
